His most important services were rendered to pure geometry, but his popular fame rests chiefly on his application of mathematical theory to mechanics.

By means of military engines which he invented he postponed the fall of Syracuse when besieged by Marcellus 214-212 b. c., whose fleet he is incorrectly said to have destroyed by mirrors reflecting the sun's rays.  He detected the admixture of silver, and determined the proportions of the two metals, in a crown ordered by Hiero to be made of pure gold.  The method of detecting the alloy, without destroying the crown, occurred to him as he stepped in the bath and observed the overflow caused by the displacement of the water.
