Born at Maria-Einsiedeln, in the Canton of Schwyz, Switzerland, Dec. 17 (or 10 Nov.), 1493: died at Salzburg, Sept. 23 (or 24), 1541.  A celebrated German-Swiss physician, reformer of therapeutics, iatrochemist, and alchemist.  He attended school in a small lead-mining district where his father, William Bombast von Hohenheim, was a physician and teacher of alchemy.  The family originally came from Würtemberg, where the noble family of Bombastus was in possession of the ancestral castle of Hohenheim near Stuttgart until 1409.  He entered the University of Basel at the age of sixteen, where he adopted the name Paracelsus, after Celsius, a noted Roman physician.  But he left without a degree, first going to Wurtzburg to study under Joannes Trithemius, Abbot of Sponheim (1462-1516), a famous astrologer and alchemist, who initiated him into the mysteries of alchemy.  He then spent many years in travel and intercourse with distinguished scholars, studied and practiced medicine and surgery, and at one point attended the Diet of Worms.  He was appointed to the office of city physician of Basel, which also made him a lecturer on medicine at Basel about 1526, where, through the publisher Johan Frobenius he made friends with the scholar Erasmus; and there he fulminated against the medical pseudo-science of his day, and against the blind adherence to ancient medical authorities such as Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna, which was still the prevalent philosophy of medicine in the sixteenth century.  But soon, in 1528, he was driven from the city by the medical corporations, whose methods he had severely criticized.  He found refuge with friends, and traveled and practiced medicine, but could not find a publisher willing to print his books.  He preached frequently the need for experimentation in medicine.  He is important in the history of medicine chiefly on account of the impetus which he gave to the development of pharmaceutical chemistry.  He was also the author of a visionary and theosophic system of philosophy.  The first collective edition of his works appeared at Basel in 1589-91.  Among the many legends concerning him is that concerning his long sword, which he obtained while serving as barber-surgeon during the Neapolitan wars.  It was rumored that in the hilt of the sword he kept a familiar or small demon; some thought he carried the elixer of life in the sword.  He is buried in the cemetary of the Hospital of St. Sebastian in Salzburg.  For more detailed information about Paracelsus, there is a special project, the Zurich Paracelsus Project available on the Web",

They are categorized as one of the classes of beta-lactam antibiotic.  They are produced naturally by some fungi and bacteria, and industrial production processes almost invariably start from some form of the penicillin nucleus produced by fermentation of microorganisms.  The fermentation products are then chemically modified to produce derivatives of enhanced potency, safety, or antibacterial spectrum.  The first penicillin to see extensive use clinically (during World War II) was penicillin G, also called benzypenicillin, and commonly simply “penicillin”",

Penicillinase production in various bacterial species may be induced, i.e., it may occur only when stimulated by the presence of penicillin in the culture medium, or it may be constitutive, i.e., it may occur whenever the cells are producing protein.  Molecular weights of the various penicillinases tend to cluster near 50,000",

It is an essential component of the genetic material of all living organisms.  The molecule contains four atoms.  Symbol P. Atomic weight 31.0",

This theory is now widely accepted, and explains many geological phenomena such as the clustered locations of earthquakes, mountain building, volcanism, and the similarities observed between the geology of continents, such as South America and Africa which are now far apart, but, according to the theory, were once joined together.  The motions of such tectonic plates are very slow, typically only several centimeters per year, but over tens and hundreds of millions of years, cause very large changes in the relative positions of the continents.  The consequence of such movement of plates is called continental drift",

It emits only alpha rays, and has a half-life of 138 days.  It is thus more unstable than radium, and a milligram of polonium emits as many alpha particles as 5 grams of radium.  Twenty-seven isotopes are known, with atomic masses from 192 to 218.

In practice these theories and methods of the post-impressionists change with great rapidity and shade into one another, so that a picture may be both cubist and futurist in character.
