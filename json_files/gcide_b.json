A notable incident of his career was his connection with the Earl of Essex, which began in July, 1591, remained an intimate friendship until the fall of Essex (1600-01), and ended in Bacon's active efforts to secure the conviction of the earl for treason. (See Essex.)   His great fame rests upon his services as a reformer of the methods of scientific investigation; and though his relation to the progress of knowledge has been exaggerated and misunderstood, his reputation as one of the chief founders of modern inductive science is well grounded.  His chief works are the \"Advancement of Learning,\" published in English as \"The Two Books of Francis Bacon of the Proficience and Advancement of Learning Divine and Human,\" in 1605; the \"Novum organum sive indicia vera de interpretatione naturae,\" published in Latin, 1620, as a \"second part\" of the (incomplete) \"Instauratio magna\"; the \"De dignitate et \naugmentis scientiarum,\" published in Latin in 1623; \"Historia Ventorum\" (1622), \"Historia Vitae et Mortis\" (1623), \"Historia Densi et Rari\" (posthumously, 1658), \"Sylva Sylvarum\" (posthumously, 1627), \"New Atlantis,\" \"Essays\" (1597, 1612, 1625), \"De Sapientia Veterum\" (1609), \"Apothegms New and Old,\" \"History of Henry VII.\" (1622). \nWorks edited by Ellis, Spedding, and Heath (7 vols. 1857); Life by Spedding \n(7 vols. 1861, 2 vols. 1878).

They are the smallest of microscopic organisms which have their own metabolic processes carried on within cell membranes, viruses being smaller but not capable of living freely.  The bacteria are very widely diffused in nature, and multiply with marvelous rapidity, both by fission and by spores.  Bacteria may require oxygen for their energy-producing metabolism, and these are called aerobes; or may multiply in the absence of oxygen, these forms being anaerobes.  Certain species are active agents in fermentation, while others appear to be the cause of certain infectious diseases.

The city of Bitola is situated in Pelagonian flat, at the foot of Baba mountain. It was established by Slavs and it was given the slavic name Obitel - Bitola. It is assumed that the city got this name because of the many monasteries being built there.  Later, during the rule of Turks, the Turks called it Monastir and it was a significant administrative and military center with 12 consulates.  It managed to preserve the primacy of a leading city, especially in the XIX century when it rapidly grew to about 40.000 inhabitants. Bitola developed trading relations with Vienna, Paris, Leipzig, London and Thessalonika to the south. In that time Bitola exceeded Skopje, both in wealth and beauty.  During World War II it was destroyed by heavy bombing.  Bitola started to grow and develop economically only after liberation in 1945.  See also Macedonia{2}",

The existence of such objects was first proposed from theoretical considerations.  Because light cannot escape from such objects, they have not yet been detected with certainty (1998), but several \"candidates\" have been observed whose properties strongly suggest that they are black holes.  Some theorists suggest that the centers of many galaxies may have large black holes at their cores.  See also escape velocity",

"definition": "The title of Siddhartha or Gautama, a deified religious teacher of the Buddhists and the founder of Buddhism; called also Gautama Siddartha or Sakya Sinha (or Muni). From three newly discovered inscriptions of the emperor Asoka it follows that the 37th year of his reign was reckoned as the 257th from the death of Buddha. Hence it is inferred that Buddha died between 482 and 472 B. C.  It being agreed that he lived to be eighty, he was born between 562 and 552 B. C.  The Buddhist narratives of his life are overgrown with legend and myth. Senart seeks to trace in them the history of the sun-hero. Oldenberg finds in the most ancient traditions -- those of Ceylon -- at least definite historical outlines. Siddhartha, as Buddha was called before entering upon his great mission, was born in the country and tribe of the Sakhyas, at the foot of the Nepalese Himalayas.  His father, Suddhodana, was rather a great and wealthy landowner than a king.  He passed his youth in opulence at Kapila-vastu, the Sakhya capital. He was married and had a son Rahula, who became a member of his order. At the age of twenty-nine he left parents, wife, and only son for the spiritual struggle of a recluse. After seven years he believed himself possessed of perfect truth, and assumed the title of Buddha, 'the enlightened.'  He is represented as having received a sudden illumination as he sat under the Bo-tree, or ' tree of knowledge,' at Bodhgaya or Buddha-Gaya. For twenty-eight or, as later narratives give it, forty-nine days he was variously tempted by Mara.  One of his doubts was whether to keep for himself the knowledge won, or to share it.  Love triumphed, and he began to preach, at first at Benares. For forty-four years he preached in the region of Benares and Behar. Primitive Buddhism is only to be gathered by inference from the literature of a later time.  Buddha did not array himself against the old religion.  The doctrines were rather the outgrowth of those of certain Brahmanical schools. His especial concern was salvation from sorrow, and so from existence. There are \"four noble truths\": (1) existence is suffering; (2) the cause of pain is desire, (3) cessation of pain is possible through the suppression of desire; (4) the way to this is the knowledge and observance of the \"good law \" of Buddha.  The end is Nirvana, the cessation of existence.  Buddhism was preached in the vulgar tongue, and had a popular literature and an elaborately organized monastic and missionary system. It made its way into Afghanistan, Bactriana., Tibet, and China. It passed away in India not from Brahman persecution, but rather from internal causes, such as its too abstract nature, too morbid view of life, relaxed discipline, and overgrowth of monasticism, and also because Shivaism and Vishnuism employed many of its own weapons more effectively.  The system has been variously modified in dogma and rites in the many countries to which it has spread. It is supposed to number about 850,000,000 of adherents, who are principally in Ceylon, Tibet, China, and Japan",

It presents release from existence (a beatific enfranchisement, Nirvâna) as the greatest good. Buddhists believe in transmigration of souls through all phases and forms of life.
